## New Ustream Proposal/Idea

### Aim



A web3 stream-to-earn platform where consumers are rewarded (airdrops/tokens/any other form of rewards) for their streams. A host of metrics will be considered when deciding on the reward system.

********

### Competition

  - Content sharing platforms. E.g. [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/), [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/), etc.
  - Video media streaming platforms. E.g. [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/), [Amazon Prime](https://www.primevideo.com/offers/nonprimehomepage/ref=dv_web_force_root), [Showmax](https://www.showmax.com/ng?), etc

### Current Challenges (faced by Ustream team)

  - No investor funds is major challenge
  - We are operating in a field that seems over-saturated, we can carve out a niche for ourselves with our stream-to-earn initiative, but without investor backing, it will take a lot of innovation.

### Proposal/Idea

For Ustream to succeed, we need to create a melting point for content creators, and consumers. We need creators on our platform so as to attract consumers.    
One way to stand out is to offer platform-exclusive content.    
How? Is it possible to sign exclusivity 'contracts' with content creators? This contracts could be time-based, and after the time has elapsed, the contents can be shared on other platforms.   
Also, we have weekly blogposts and social media handles that celebrate the most viewed, most liked, and most shared contents per week. There can be a leaderboard for these. Ustream user accounts can also share link of their favourite content to their social media handles. The links that result to the highest number of views, and converted users are given higher priority for rewards (during airdrops).   
The bigger our community grows, the more features we add. We will also be able to incorporate adverts as a revenue-generating tool. But, our implementation will be unique.

While potential server costs mean that we have to focus on shorter content forms (skits especially), there might reach a point where we have to consider longer content forms. Budding movie creators upload their content to [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/), we could be able to come up with an agreement that targets this class of content creators, and perhaps make this a premium feature on our platform.

#### Blockchain-powered Features

  - User sign-in with web3 wallet
  - Airdrop/Token (when that time comes)
  - etc.

#### Ways we can generate revenue

The number one way is through advert placements on our platform. But we would have to be creative about it so that we don't turn to Facebook Marketplace.
